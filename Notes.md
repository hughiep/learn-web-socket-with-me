- Event-driven: Event-driven programming is a programming paradigm in which the flow of the program
is determined by events such as user actions (mouse clicks, key presses), sensor outputs, or messages from other programs/threads.

- Duplex: A duplex communication system is a point-to-point system composed of two or more connected parties
or devices that can communicate with one another in both directions.

- Full Duplex: Full-duplex data transmission means that data can be transmitted in both directions on a signal carrier at the same time.

It is a form of communication that allows two different devices to send and receive data.

Compare with Long Polling

## Long pooling

- Keep the connection open/alive until the server has new data to send to the client.
- When server has new data, the client will receive it and immediately send a new request to the server.
